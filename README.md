## Project for BeachHacks 2019
Inspired by a friend, who was a nurse, was frustrated with the formalities, and book keeping associated with patient care. As well as to get hands-on insight in radio-frequency technology, data processing, and user interaction with modern interfaces. 

The project allows for patients and health care professionals a more streamlined system in delivering medication to the patient in order to expedite wait times in waiting rooms and or nursing homes.
